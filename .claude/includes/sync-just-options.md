Every public singular recipe parameter must be a documented command-line option:

- Declare `[arg(..., long, help=...)]`, or use an intentional short option with `help=...`.
- Convert parameter names to lowercase kebab case (`OUTPUT_FILE` becomes `--output-file`).
- Model boolean behavior as a semantic value-less flag such as `--warn`, `--quick`, or `--no-clean`, preserving the recipe's existing default behavior.
- Keep private helper parameters such as `_run command` positional.
- Keep variadic passthrough parameters such as `*FLAGS` and `*args` positional.
- Keep dependency expressions inside justfiles positional. Only command-line callers use option syntax.

From this template's root, run its audit against the template and every selected project. The audit loads every tracked root and nested justfile through `just --dump --dump-format json` and reports public singular parameters that lack an option or option help text.

```bash
python3 scripts/audit-just-options.py <project-path>
```

Create one task per failing project that lists every reported recipe and parameter. The task must require the corresponding option declaration, caller migrations, `just --usage <recipe>` inspection, representative `just --dry-run` calls, and a passing audit. Do not create conversion tasks for private helpers or variadic passthrough parameters.

Each sibling template's `.claude/commands/sync-template.md` must include this file, and its shared copy must remain byte-identical to the base template. A missing include, different copy, or audit failure is an out-of-sync condition that requires a task.
